Hi, welcome to my GitHub account. Here you will find class and personal projects I occassionally contribute to.

My area of interest is embedded systems. If I can choose any language to program in for a given project, I will tend to choose C.

## My career

I began my career at Aruba Networks working as an embedded software engineer on software of enterprise-grade network switches.

I then did full-stack software development at Amazon working on and improving internal tooling that enables A/B testing company-wide. I have since pivoted back into embedded software.

Though I am currently employed, if you know of any career opportunities in embedded systems, please email me!
