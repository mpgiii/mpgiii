# mpgiii

Hi, welcome to my GitHub repo. Here you will find class and personal projects I occassionally contribute to.

My area of interest is embedded systems. If I can choose any language to program in for a given project, I will tend to choose C.

## My career

I began my career at Aruba Networks working as an embedded software engineer on software of enterprise-grade network switches.

I am currently a full-stack software development engineer at Amazon working in the Amazon Fashion space.

## What I use GitHub for

I use GitHub for a variety of things, including:

- Maintaining [my resume in LaTeX](https://github.com/mpgiii/resume) ([click here for the pdf](https://georgariou.com/resume.pdf))
- Hosting [my personal website](https://georgariou.com)
- Maintaining [the website for my father's law firm](https://github.com/mpgiii/forworker) ([click here to view the site](https://sprenklegeorgariou.com))
- Research projects (such as [my research on trends of hate speech on right-wing social media platform Gab](https://github.com/mpgiii/gab-hate))
- Side projects (such as my in-progress self-made [GameBoy emulator](https://github.com/mpgiii/mpgameboy))
- Past school projects I am particularly proud of (such as my [weather station written in C for the MSP432](https://github.com/mpgiii/MSP432-Weather-Station))

## Want to reach me?
